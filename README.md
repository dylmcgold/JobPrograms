1. Put your cover letter text into the cover letter string. Where ever you have the company or job title mentioned in your cover letter, replace them with generic names, I'm using xvar and yvar in this example. 

2. Replace x with the name of the company and y with the position title that you are applying to, and then run the program. Apostrophes should be handled. Your text will be automatically copied to your clipboard. 

3. Use your word processor to paste the copied text into the document. I then save and export the file under the name "xvar.pdf" and save in the root directory where the programs and cover letter directory live. You can change the names as you see fit, it works fine for me using "xvar."

4. After you have saved your modified cover letter in the root directory, put the resume you would like to use in the root directory as well. Change the names of the circled variables as needed.

5. Then run the file and hopefully you should see the merged resume and cover letter in a cover letter directory. This is the pdf you can submit to companies in the Resume/CV section of most applications.


If you make multiple cover letters for the same company this program will overwrite it, so be sure to modify the code if that's what you want. 

Good luck with your applications and job hunting process!
